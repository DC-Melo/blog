# ▽  clipboard in ssh
$ export DISPLAY=:0
$ echo 'some text' | xclip -selection clipboard
I was struggling with the system clipboard and vim inside tmux.

It was solved by using xsel or xclip, like in this example:

1.) visually select a block text in normal mode: V<motionkey>

2.a) with xsel run ex: :'<,'>w !xsel -b

2.b) with xclip run ex: :'<,'>w !xclip -selection clipboard
If for some reason your version of vim under Unix-like system has no support for clipboard, you can use a handy utility called xsel. Xsel lets you manipulate X selections (check man xsel for more info). To work around the lack of clipboard I use following mappings:

" Copy to X CLIPBOARD
map <leader>cc :w !xsel -i -b<CR>
map <leader>cp :w !xsel -i -p<CR>
map <leader>cs :w !xsel -i -s<CR>
" Paste from X CLIPBOARD
map <leader>pp :r!xsel -p<CR>
map <leader>ps :r!xsel -s<CR>
map <leader>pb :r!xsel -b<CR>
So, to paste from X clipboard, you use :r!xsel -p|-s|-b depending which X clipboard you want to access. To copy, use :w!xsel -i -p|-s|-b.

This was recently added, but there is no indication why it is useful or needed. I have moved it here for now because to my knowledge the normal clipboard access commands should work and are much more desireable.
ichigan Tech has a very succinct explanation of how to use Xming here:

Installing/Configuring PuTTy and Xming

Excerpt:

The PC interacts with the server through the X-windows system, forwarding the display from the server to the PC. Software must be installed on the PC to make this link work and the best software (so far) for this task is the PuTTy terminal emulator and the Xming X-window client.

PuTTy can be downloaded from https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html

Xming can be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=156984&filename=Xming-6-9-0-31-setup.exe

Once Xming is installed, run the application called 'XLaunch' and verify that the settings are:

1)  Display Settings:  Multiple Windows
2)  Session Type:  Start no client
3)  Additional Parameters:  Check Clipboard box
Then in your PuTTY session you can turn on the X11: Enable X11 Forwarding
Xming is the leading X Window System Server for Microsoft Windows 8/7/Vista/XP (+ server 2012/2008/2003). It is fully featured, small and fast, simple to install and because it is standalone native Microsoft Windows, easily made portable (not needing a machine-specific installation).

This was too good of an answer not to post it here. It's from a Gilles, a fellow user from askubuntu:

The clipboard is provided by the X server. It doesn't matter whether the server is headless or not, what matters is that your local graphical session is available to programs running on the remote machine. Thanks to X's network-transparent design, this is possible.

I assume that you're connecting to the remote server with SSH from a machine running Linux. Make sure that X11 forwarding is enabled both in the client configuration and in the server configuration. In the client configuration, you need to have the line ForwardX11 yes in ~/.ssh/config to have it on by default, or pass the option -X to the ssh command just for that session. In the server configuration, you need to have the line X11Forwarding yes in /etc/ssh/sshd_config (it is present by default on Ubuntu).

To check whether X11 forwarding is enabled, look at the value of the DISPLAY environment variable: echo $DISPLAY. You should see a value like localhost:10 (applications running on the remote machine are told to connect to a display running on the same machine, but that display connection is in fact forwarded by SSH to your client-side display). Note that if DISPLAY isn't set, it's no use setting it manually: the environment variable is always set correctly if the forwarding is in place. If you need to diagnose SSH connection issues, pass the option -vvv to ssh to get a detailed trace of what's happening.

If you're connecting through some other means, you may or may not be able to achieve X11 forwarding. If your client is running Windows, PuTTY supports X11 forwarding; you'll have to run an X server on the Windows machine such as Xming.
