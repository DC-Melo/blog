Ctrl+C
You can use Ctrl+C to kill and exit the currently running process in the shell. This is extremely useful when you need to kill a process because it is misbehaving or is taking too long to complete.

Ctrl+C essentially sends a SIGINT signal from the controlling terminal to the process, causing it to be killed. It is equivalent to using the kill command (or system call) with the process id.

Ctrl+\
Closely related to Ctrl+C is the Ctrl+\ shortcut. It basically sends the SIGQUIT signal which will the process to terminate and dump core. This is useful when the process or program is misbehaving and you want to find out why. The core dump file can be used to debug the program.


Ctrl+Z
Sometimes you just want to suspend the process and not kill it. Suspending the process will allow you to resume the process at a later time. The keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Z sends the SIGTSTP signal to the process which causes it to suspend its processing or execution for the time being.

You can resume the process later by using the fg command.

Ctrl+T
The Ctrl+T shortcut is not widely available across all shells or terminals. This is essentially to print out detailed information about the executing process. It is equivalent to the SIGINFO signal being send to the process.

Ctrl+D
This shortcut works as a way to close the currently executing shell, and logout the user. It sends an EOF marker to the shell, and it will exit the current shell. This is more of a graceful exit to shell or the process compared to the Ctrl+C mentioned above.

If you have logged in as another user or started another child shell from with in the shell, then it will lose the child shell and exit to the parent shell. This is useful when using su to login as super user or another user.
