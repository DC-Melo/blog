1. Introduction
Newsboat is an RSS/Atom feedreader. RSS and Atom are a number of widely-used XML formats to transmit, publish and syndicate articles, for example news or blog articles. Newsboat is designed to be used on text terminals on Unix or Unix-like systems such as GNU/Linux, FreeBSD or macOS.

1.1. Platforms
Newsboat has been tested on Linux (with glibc and musl-libc), FreeBSD and macOS.

NetBSD is currently not supported, due to technical limitations in the iconv() implementation.

1.2. Why "Newsboat"?
"Newsboat" is a play on the name of its ancestor, "Newsbeuter". They’re spelled quite differently, but sound similar. ("Newsbeuter" is a pun on German word "wildbeuter"; "newsboat" is an English word.)

Newsboats were the vessels that collected and delivered news shuffling between boats in the port. Newsboat the program will collect the news for you, just like its namesakes did back in the day.

2. Installation
This chapter describes how to compile and install newsboat from source.

2.1. Downloading Newsboat
Newsboat is available as source package. Simply go to https://newsboat.org/ and download the latest source package, which is usually in the .tar.gz file format. Alternatively, you can check out the latest development source tree from the newsboat Git repository by running the following command on the commandline:

git clone git://github.com/newsboat/newsboat.git
2.2. Dependencies
Newsboat depends on a number of libraries to function correctly. This table lists these dependencies. Please be aware that the list libraries may themselves depend on other libraries. These dependencies are not listed here. Please also be aware that you need a recent C++ compiler.

GCC 4.9 or newer, or Clang 3.6 or newer
STFL (version 0.21 or newer)
SQLite3 (version 3.5 or newer)
libcurl (version 7.18.0 or newer)
GNU gettext (on systems that don’t provide gettext in the libc)
pkg-config
libxml2
json-c (version 0.11 or newer)
If you intend to modify and regenerate the filter language parser, you will also need Coco/R for C++, which you can download from http://www.ssw.uni-linz.ac.at/coco/. The Coco/R binary must be installed as cococpp in your PATH. Debian users only need to install the package coco-cpp. Use the regenerate-parser make target to regenerate the necessary files.

2.3. Compiling and Installing
After you’ve downloaded and installed the dependencies mentioned above, you can start compiling and installing newsboat. To compile newsboat, simply run make in the source tree. After a short time, this should complete successfully, and you can go on with installation by running make install. By default, this will install the newsboat binary to the /usr/local/bin directory. You can provide an alternative installation path using the prefix parameter, e.g. running make install prefix=/opt/newsboat will install the binary to the directory /opt/newsboat/bin.

3. First Steps
After you’ve installed newsboat, you can run it for the first time by typing newsboat on your command prompt. This will bring you the following message:

Error: no URLs configured. Please fill the file /home/ak/.newsboat/urls with RSS feed URLs or import an OPML file.
newsboat 2.10
usage: ./newsboat [-i <file>|-e] [-u <urlfile>] [-c <cachefile>] [-x <command> ...] [-h]
        -e, --export-to-opml            export OPML feed to stdout
        -r, --refresh-on-start          refresh feeds on start
        -i, --import-from-opml=<file>   import OPML file

        -c, --cache-file=<cachefile>    use <cachefile> as cache file
        -C, --config-file=<configfile>  read configuration from <configfile>
        -X, --vacuum                    compact the cache
        -x, --execute=<command>...      execute list of commands
        -q, --quiet                     quiet startup
        -v, --version                   get version information
        -l, --log-level=<loglevel>      write a log with a certain loglevel (valid values: 1 to 6)

        -I, --import-from-file=<file>   import list of read articles from <file>
        -h, --help                      this help
This means that newsboat can’t start without any configured feeds. To add feeds to newsboat, you can either add URLs to the configuration file $HOME/.newsboat/urls or you can import an OPML file by running newsboat -i blogroll.opml. To manually add URLs, open the file with your favorite text editor and add the URLs, one per line:

http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss
http://newsrss.bbc.co.uk/rss/newsonline_world_edition/front_page/rss.xml
If you need to add URLs that have restricted access via username/password, simply provide the username/password in the following way:

http://username:password@hostname.domain.tld/feed.rss
In order to protect username and password, make sure that $HOME/.newsboat/urls has the appropriate permissions. Newsboat also makes sure that usernames and passwords within URLs aren’t displayed in its user interface. In case there is a @ in the username, you need to write it as %40 instead so that it can be distinguished from the @ that separates the username/password part from the hostname part.

You can also configure local files as feeds, by prefixing the local path with file:// and adding it to the $HOME/.newsboat/urls file:

file:///var/log/rss_eventlog.xml
Now you can run newsboat again, and it will present you with a controllable list of the URLs that you configured previously. You can now start downloading the feeds, either by pressing "R" to download all feeds, or by pressing "r" to download the currently selected feed. You can then select a feed you want to read, and by pressing "Enter", you can go to the article list for this feed. This works even while the downloading is still in progress. You can now see the list of available articles by their title. A "N" on the left indicates that an article wasn’t read yet. Pressing "Enter" brings you to the content of the article. You can scroll through this text, and also run a browser (default: lynx) to view the complete article if the content is empty or just an abstract or a short description. Pressing "q" brings you back to the article list, and pressing "q" again brings you back to the feed list. Pressing "q" a third time then closes newsboat.

Newsboat caches the article that it downloads. This means that when you start newsboat again and reload a feed, the old articles can still be read even if they aren’t in the current RSS feeds anymore. Optionally you can configure how many articles shall be preserved by feed so that the article backlog doesn’t grow endlessly (see max-items below).

Newsboat also uses a number of measures to preserve the users' and feed providers' bandwidth, by trying to avoid unnecessary feed downloads through the use of conditional HTTP downloading. It saves every feed’s "Last-Modified" and "ETag" response header values (if present) and advises the feed’s HTTP server to only send data if the feed has been updated by modification date/time or "ETag" header. This doesn’t only make feed downloads for RSS feeds with no new updates faster, it also reduces the amount of transferred data per request. Conditional HTTP downloading can be optionally disabled per feed by using the always-download configuration command.

Several aspects of newsboat’s behaviour can be configured via a configuration file, by default $HOME/.newsboat/config. This configuration file contains lines in the form <config-command> <arg1> .... The configuration file can also contain comments, which start with the # character and go as far as the end of line. If you need to enter a configuration argument that contains spaces, use quotes (") around the whole argument. It’s even possible to integrate the output of external commands into the configuration. The text between two backticks (`) is evaluated as shell command, and its output is put on its place instead. This works like backtick evaluation in Bourne-compatible shells and allows users to use external information from the system within the configuration. Backticks can be escaped with a backslash (\`); in that case, they’ll be replaced with a literal backtick in the configuration.

Searching for articles is possible in newsboat, too. Just press the "/" key, enter your search phrase, and the title and content of all articles are searched for it. When you do a search from the list of feeds, all articles of all feeds will be searched. When you do a search from the article list of a feed, only the articles of the currently viewed feed are searched. When opening an article from a search result dialog, the search phrase is highlighted.

The history of all your searches is saved to the filesystem, to ~/.newsboat/history.search. By default, the last 100 search phrases are stored, but this limited can be influenced through the history-limit configuration variable. To disable search history saving, simply set the history-limit to 0.

Keys, as used in the bind-key configuration command, use a special syntax. Lowercase keys, uppercase keys and special characters are written literally. The "Enter" key is written as ENTER, while the "Esc" key is written as ESC. The function keys "F1" to "F12" are written as F1 to F12. The "Space" key is written as SPACE. Key combinations with the "Ctrl" key, such as "Ctrl-R", are written as ^R. Please be aware that all Ctrl-related key combinations need to be written in uppercase. The following identifiers for keys are supported:

ENTER (Enter key)
BACKSPACE (backspace key)
LEFT (left cursor)
RIGHT (right cursor)
UP (up cursor)
PPAGE (page up cursor)
NPAGE (page down cursor)
DOWN (down cursor)
ESC (Esc key)
The "Tab" key can’t be bound due to technical limitations of STFL.

3.1. Example Configuration
# a comment
max-items        100 # such comments are possible, too
browser          links
show-read-feeds  no
unbind-key       R
bind-key         ^R    reload-all
3.2. Configuring Colors
It is possible to configure custom color settings in newsboat. The basic configuration syntax is:

color <element> <foreground color> <background color> [<attribute> ...]
This means that if you configure colors for a certain element, you need to provide a foreground color and a background color as a minimum. The following colors are supported:

black
red
green
yellow
blue
magenta
cyan
white
default
color<n>, e.g. color123
The default color means that the terminal’s default color will be used. The color<n> color name (where <n> is a decimal number not starting with zero) can be used if your terminal support 256 colors (e.g. gnome-terminal, xterm with $TERM set to xterm-256color). Newsboat contains support for 256 color terminals since version 2.1. For a complete chart of colors and their corresponding numbers, please see http://www.calmar.ws/vim/256-xterm-24bit-rgb-color-chart.html.

Optionally, you can also add one or more attributes. The following attributes are supported:

standout
underline
reverse
blink
dim
bold
protect
invis
Currently, the following elements are supported:

listnormal: a normal list item
listfocus: the currently selected list item
listnormal_unread: an unread list item
listfocus_unread: the currently selected and unread list item
info: the info bars on top and bottom
background: the application background
article: the article text
The default color configuration of newsboat looks like this:

color background          white   black
color listnormal          white   black
color listfocus           yellow  blue   bold
color listnormal_unread   magenta black
color listfocus_unread    magenta blue   bold
color info                yellow  blue   bold
color article             white   black
3.3. Migrating from other RSS Feed Readers
It is very likely that you have used other RSS feed readers before. In this case, it is practical to migrate the previous configuration to newsboat.

Newsbeuter (automatic migration)
Newsboat is a fork of Newsbeuter, so the migration from the latter is partially automated. Simple enough configurations will be transferred without any user intervention, while more complicated ones might require a little tweaking afterwards.

To prevent data loss, please check the results before deleting your old configuration. Pay extra attention to files that you include in your configuration—you’d probably want to manually copy them over to Newsboat directories, and possibly update the include paths.

Migration from Newsbeuter is attempted on startup if the following conditions are met:

none of -u, -c, -C options were specified; and
the urls file doesn’t exist (neither ~/.newsboat/urls nor $XDG_CONFIG_DIR/newsboat/urls).
Newsboat first tries to migrate an XDG configuration, and if that fails, it tries the dotdir one. If that fails as well, Newsboat proceeds with the startup as usual.

XDG migration checks that:

$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/newsbeuter/ is readable and executable; and
neither $XDG_CONFIG_DIR/newsboat/ nor $XDG_DATA_DIR/newsboat/ exist.
If both conditions are met, Newsboat tries to create its XDG dirs (aborting the migration if that fails), then copies the following files: urls and config from config dir; cache.db, queue, history.search, history.cmdline from data dir.

Dotdir migration checks that ~/.newsbeuter/ is readable and executable, and ~/.newsboat/ doesn’t exist. If those conditions are met, it tries to create ~/.newsboat/ (aborting the migration if that fails), then copies the following files: urls, cache.db, config, queue, history.search, history.cmdline.

There’s one scenario where the process breaks: if you have an XDG configuration for Newsbeuter, ~/.newsboat/ exists and ~/.newsboat/urls doesn’t exist, then Newsboat will migrate XDG files and proceed, ignoring the dotdir. Please don’t confuse the poor program like that!

Other readers (via OPML)
The vast amount of RSS feed readers allows the export of subscriptions via OPML files. OPML is an XML file format that was designed to save outlines, and has found its primary use in the import and export of feed subscriptions between different RSS feed readers.

The best thing to start with is to export your subscriptions from the old reader. Usually, RSS feed readers have appropriate menu items available to do so.

Snownews provides a script to convert your current subscription file into an OPML file:

snow2opml > ~/blogroll.opml
This command creates from your Snownews configuration a file blogroll.opml in your home directory. To export the subscription list from raggle, the following command is necessary:

raggle --export-opml ~/blogroll.opml
When you have exported the subscriptions from your old RSS feed reader, you can import them into newsboat:

newsboat -i ~/blogroll.opml
Don’t worry, newsboat won’t destroy your existing configuration, or add subscriptions more than once: every URL that is added to the subscription list is checked before whether it is already in the list, and is only added if not. This makes it possible to merge several OPML files into your subscription list.

If your old RSS feed reader was able to structure your subscriptions in hierarchies, and reflected this structure in the exported OPML file, newsboat doesn’t throw away this information (although it doesn’t support hierarchies), but generates tags from it. Tags are newsboat’s way of organizing subscriptions in a non-hierarchical way. More information on the use of tags can be found below.

Imagine the following folder hierarchy:

|- News
| |- Europe
| `- International
|- IT
| |- Linux
| |- Windows
| `- Programming
|   |- C++
|   |- Ruby
|   `- Erlang
`- Private
Subscriptions found in the folder "Private" will be tagged with "Private", subscriptions in the folder "International" will be tagged with "News" and "News/International", subscriptions in the folder "Erlang" will be tagged ith "IT", "IT/Programming" and "IT/Programming/Erlang", and so on. This means that when you select the tag "Programming" in newsboat, you will see all subscriptions that were in the "Programming" folder or one of its subfolders before. This means that you will lose virtually nothing of your previously configured structure.

4. Advanced Features
4.1. Tagging
Newsboat comes with the possibility to categorize or "tag", as we call it, RSS feeds. Every RSS feed can be assigned 0 or more tags. Within newsboat, you can then select to only show RSS feeds that match a certain tag. That makes it easy to categorize your feeds in a flexible and powerful way.

Usually, the ~/.newsboat/urls file contains one RSS feed URL per line. To assign a tag to an RSS feed, simply attach it as a single word, separated by blanks such as space or tab. If the tag needs to contain spaces, you must use quotes (") around the tag (see example below). An example ~/.newsboat/urls file may look like this:

http://blog.fefe.de/rss.xml?html interesting conspiracy news "cool stuff"
http://rss.orf.at/news.xml news orf
http://www.heise.de/newsticker/heise.rdf news interesting
When you now start newsboat with this configuration, you can press "t" to select a tag. When you select the tag "news", you will see all three RSS feeds. Pressing "t" again and e.g. selecting the "conspiracy" tag, you will only see the http://blog.fefe.de/rss.xml?html RSS feed. Pressing "^T" clears the current tag, and again shows all RSS feeds, regardless of their assigned tags.

A special type of tag are tags that start with the tilde character (~). When such a tag is found, the feed title is set to the tag name (excluding the ~ character). With this feature, you can give feeds any title you want in your feed list:

http://rss.orf.at/news.xml "~ORF News"
Another special type of tag are tags that start with the exclamation mark (!). When such a tag is found, the feed is hidden from the regular list of feeds and its content can only be found through a query feed.

http://rss.orf.at/news.xml "!ORF News (hidden)"
4.2. Scripts and Filters (Snownews Extensions)
Newsboat contains support for Snownews extensions. The RSS feed readers Snownews and Liferea share a common way of extending the readers with custom scripts. Two mechanisms, namely "execurl" and "filter" type scripts, are available and supported by newsboat.

An "execurl" script can be any program that gets executed and whose output is interpreted as RSS feed, while "filter" scripts are fed with the content of a configured URL and whose output is interpreted as RSS feed.

The configuration is simple and straight-forward. Just add to your ~/.newsboat/urls file configuration lines like the following ones:

exec:~/bin/execurl-script
filter:~/bin/filter-script:http://some.test/url
The first line shows how to add an execurl script to your configuration: start the line with exec: and then immediately append the path of the script that shall be executed. If this script requires additional parameters, simply use quotes:

"exec:~/bin/execurl-script param1 param2"
The second line shows how to add a filter script to your configuration: start the line with filter:, then immediately append the path of the script, then append a colon (:), and then append the URL of the file that shall be fed to the script. Again, if the script requires any parameters, simply quote:

"filter:~/bin/filter-script param1 param2:http://url/foobar"
In both cases, the tagging feature as described above is still available:

exec:~/bin/execurl-script tag1 tag2 "quoted tag"
filter:~/bin/filter-script:http://some.test/url tag3 tag4 tag5
A collection of such extension scripts can be found on this website: https://kiza.eu/software/snownews/snowscripts/extensions/

If you want to write your own extensions, refer to this website for further instructions: https://web.archive.org/web/20090724045314/http://kiza.kcore.de/software/snownews/snowscripts/writing

4.3. Bookmarking
Newsboat contains a plugin-based bookmarking system. When a user bookmarks a link (possible in the article list, in the article view, and in the URL view), they are asked for the URL to bookmark (already preset with the URL of the current selection), the bookmark title (in most cases preset with the title of the current selection), the bookmark description and (since 2.10) the title of the feed the user is currently in. After the question for the description, an external program, configured via the configuration command bookmark-cmd, is executed with 4 (since 2.10) commandline parameters. The plugin itself implements the actual bookmark saving (e.g. writing the bookmark to an external file, or storing it to a del.icio.us account). If everything went OK, the plugin simply exits. In case something goes wrong while saving the bookmark, it writes out an error message as a single line. This error message is then presented to the user from within newsboat.

Newsboat comes with an example plugin, which implements a simple tab-separated bookmark file. This example can be found in the contrib subdirectory.

4.4. Command Line
Like other text-oriented software, Newsboat contains an internal commandline to modify configuration variables ad hoc and to run own commands. It provides a flexible access to the functionality of Newsboat which is especially useful for advanced users.

To start the commandline, type ":". You will see a ":" prompt at the bottom of the screen, similar to tools like vi(m) or mutt. You can now enter commands. Pressing the "Enter" key executes the command (possibly giving feedback to the user) and closes the commandline. You can cancel entering commands by pressing the "Esc" key. The history of all the commands that you enter will be saved to ~/.newsboat/history.cmdline. The backlog is limited to 100 entries by default, but can be influenced by setting the history-limit configuration variable. To disable history saving, set the history-limit to 0.

The commandline provides you with some help if you can’t remember the full names of commandline commands. By pressing the "Tab" key, newsboat will try to automatically complete your command. If there is more than one possible completion, you can subsequently press the "Tab" key to cycle through all results. If no match is found, no suggestion will be inserted into the commandline. For the set command, the completion also works for configuration variable names.

In addition, some common key combination such as "Ctrl-G" (to cancel input), "Ctrl-K" (to delete text from the cursor position to the end of line), "Ctrl-U" (to clear the whole line) and "Ctrl-W" (to delete the word before the current cursor position) were added.

Please be aware that the input history of both the command line and the search functions are saved to the filesystems, to the files ~/.newsboat/history.cmdline resp. ~/.newsboat/history.search. By default, the last 100 entries are saved, but this can be configured (configuration variable history-limit) and also totally disabled (by setting said variable to 0).

Currently, the following command line commands are available:

Table 3. Available Commandline Commands

Command	Syntax	Description	Example
quit

quit

Quit newsboat.

quit
save

save <filename>

Save the currently select article to disk. This works in the article list and in the article view.

save ~/important.txt
set

set <variable>[=<value>|&|!]

Set configuration variable <variable> to <value>. If no value is specified, the current value is printed out. Specifying a ! after the name of boolean configuration variables toggles their values, a & directly after the name of a configuration variable of any type resets its value to the documented default value.

set reload-time=15
tag

tag <tagname>

Only display feeds with the tag <tagname>.

tag news
goto

goto <case-insensitive substring>

Go to the next feed whose name contains the case-insensitive substring.

goto foo
source

source <filename> […]

Load the specified configuration files. This allows it to load alternative configuration files or reload already loaded configuration files on-the-fly from the filesystem.

source ~/.newsboat/colors
dumpconfig

dumpconfig <filename>

Save current internal state of configuration to file, so that it can be instantly reused as configuration file.

dumpconfig ~/.newsboat/config.saved
dumpform

dumpform

Dump current dialog to text file. This is meant for debugging purposes only.

dumpform
n/a

<number>

Jump to the entry with the index <number> (usually seen at the left side of the list). This currently works for the feed list and the article list.

30

4.5. Filter Language
Newsboat provides a powerful filter language that enables the user to filter the content of many dialogs, such as the feed list or the article list. The basic concept is that every feed and every article has a number of attributes which can then be compared with user-supplied values, and these comparisons and be logically AND’ed, OR’ed and grouped.

Examples for simple filter expressions are:

unread_count > 0
rssurl =~ "^https:"
age between 0:10
Logically connecting and grouping such expressions looks like in the following examples:

( unread_count > 0 and unread_count < 10 ) or total_count > 100
( author =~ "Frank" or author =~ "John" ) and ( title =~ "Linux" or title =~ "FreeBSD" )
The possibilities for combining such queries is endless, sky (actually: the available memory) is the limit.

To filter your feeds, press "F" in the feed list, enter your filter expression, and press "Enter". To clear the filter, press "Ctrl-F". To filter the articles in the article list, press "F", enter your expression, and press "Enter". Clearing the filter works the same as before. Be aware that only certain attributes work in both dialogs. The table below lists all available attributes and their context, i.e. an attribute that belongs to a feed can only be matched in the feed list, while an attribute that belongs to an article can only be matched in the article list.

Note that it’s also possible to filter for feed attributes when you query for article attributes. This is because every article is internally linked to the feed from which it was downloaded.

4.6. Killfiles
Sometimes, a user is confronted with certain content they don’t want to read, e.g. on topics the user is not interested in or articles written by certain people. In Usenet, such functionality within software is traditionally called a "killfile", i.e. based on the content of this "killfile", articles that match certain conditions do not get displayed and are not presented to the user at all.

In newsboat, such a "killfile" can be implemented on a per-article basis via the configuration file. The most important configuration command for this is ignore-article:

ignore-article "*" "title =~ \"Gentoo\""
ignore-article "http://synflood.at/blog/index.php?/feeds/index.rss2" "title =~ \"newsboat\""
The basic format is that the user specifies an RSS feed for which the ignore shall be applied ("*" matches all RSS feeds), and then a filter expression (see previous section). If newsboat hits an article in the specified RSS feed that matches the specified filter expression, then this article is ignored and never presented to the user. The configuration itself can contain as many ignore-article commands as desired.

You can also specify the way an article is ignored. There are two ways available:

During download: articles are ignored when a feed is downloaded and parsed, and thus won’t be written to the local cache.
During display: articles are downloaded and written to the local cache, but are ignored when a feed is displayed.
Both modes have their advantages and disadvantages: while the download ignore mode saves some storage, you cannot simply "undo" the ignore by removing it from the configuration file: if an ignored article has already vanished from a feed, it won’t reappear. On the other hand, the display ignore mode requires some more space, but has the advantage that an ignore can be "undone" by removing the ignore-article configuration command from the configuration.

The default ignore mode is "download". You can set the ignore-mode in the configuration file:

ignore-mode "display"
4.7. Query Feeds
Query feeds are a mechanism of newsboat to define custom "meta feeds" by using newsboat’s built-in filter language. A query feed is a feed that is aggregated from all currently downloaded articles of all feeds. To narrow down the set of articles, the user has to specify a filter. Only articles that match this filter are added to the query feed.

A query feed is updated whenever it is entered in the feed list. When you change the unread flag of an article, this is reflected in the feed where the article was originally fetched. If you want query feeds to be updated at startup, set prepopulate-query-feeds to yes.

To define a query feed, the user has to add a line to the file ~/.newsboat/urls in the following format:

query:<name of feed>:<filter expression> [<tag> ...]
The query: in the beginning tells newsboat that it’s a query feed, <name of feed> specifies the name under which the query feed shall be displayed in the feed list, and <filter expression> is the filter expression that shall be used. Like every other feed, a query feed can be tagged to organize it like a regular feed.

This feature is often used to create a feed that contains all unread articles:

"query:Unread Articles:unread = \"yes\""
Note the quotes that are necessary around the complete query "URL" and the backslashes that are necessary to escape the quotes in the filter expression.

If you want to combine several feeds to one single feed, a good solution is to tag the feeds that you want to combine with one certain tag, and then create a query feed that only displays articles from feeds with that certain tag:

http://domain1.tld/feed.xml fun news tag1
http://domain2.tld/?feed.rss private jokes tag1
http://domain3.tld/feeds.rss news
"query:tag1 Articles:tags # \"tag1\""
In this example, the feeds http://domain1.tld/feed.xml and http://domain2.tld/?feed.rss are aggregated into the query feed named "tag1 Articles", but the feed http://domain3.tld/feeds.rss is not.

Basically, the possibility of what can be realized with query feeds is only limited by what can be queried from articles and feeds with the filter language and by your creativity.

4.8. The Old Reader Support
The Old Reader is a successor to Google Reader. Newsboat provides functionality to use The Old Reader as its backend: people can use The Old Reader to manage their subscriptions, and in addition, use newsboat to download and read articles. Newsboat will keep the information which articles have already been read synchronized with The Old Reader, so that users usually won’t see articles more than once. In addition, it will only ever download unread articles from The Old Reader.

In order to use The Old Reader support, you first need to configure the proper URL source:

urls-source "oldreader"
In addition, newsboat needs to know your The Old Reader username and password so that it can authenticate with The Old Reader:

oldreader-login "your-oldreader-account"
oldreader-password "your-password"
Note that double quotes should be escaped, i.e. you should write \" instead of ".

See also oldreaader-passwordfile, oldreader-passwordeval and Section 4.25, “Passwords for external APIs”.

After setting these configuration values, you can start newsboat, it will authenticate with The Old Reader and download your subscription list. If you use "folders" in The Old Reader to organize your feeds, newsboat will regard them and make them available via its "tags" capability: each feed is tagged with the name of the folder in which it resides.

When you mark single items or complete feeds as read, newsboat will synchronize this information directly to The Old Reader. This, of course, includes opening articles. Toggling read articles back to "unread" is also communicated to The Old Reader.

In addition, The Old Reader provides the ability to "star" and to "share" articles. Starred articles are basically bookmarks, while shared articles are shown to people that follow your The Old Reader account. Newsboat allows the use of this feature by mapping its powerful "flags" to the "star"/"unstar" resp. "share"/"unshare" operations.

In order to use this mapping, all you need to do is to configure the flags that shall be used:

oldreader-flag-share "a"
oldreader-flag-star "b"
After that, use these flags when you edit flags for an article, and these articles will be starred resp. shared.

By default, newsboat also shows The Old Reader "special feeds":

People you follow: articles shared by people that you follow.
Starred items: articles that you starred.
Shared items: articles that you shared.
You can disable these feeds by setting the following configuration variable:

oldreader-show-special-feeds no
The Old Reader’s folders are converted into Newsboat tags. You can select and filter feeds by tags; see Section 4.1, “Tagging” and Section 4.5, “Filter Language” for details.

4.9. NewsBlur Support
Newsboat also supports NewsBlur, another alternative to Google Reader. Configuration basically works the same as with The Old Reader.

First, set your urls-source:

urls-source "newsblur"
Then, configure your NewsBlur credentials:

newsblur-login "your-newsblur-account"
newsblur-password "your-password"
Note that double quotes should be escaped, i.e. you should write \" instead of ".

See also newsblur-passwordfile, newsblur-passwordeval and Section 4.25, “Passwords for external APIs”.

When you start newsboat, it will download the feeds that you configured in NewsBlur. Please take a closer look at the configuration commands for what you can configure in newsboat regarding NewsBlur.

NewsBlur’s folders are converted into Newsboat tags. You can select and filter feeds by tags; see Section 4.1, “Tagging” and Section 4.5, “Filter Language” for details.

4.10. FeedHQ Support
Newsboat also supports FeedHQ, another alternative to Google Reader. Configuration basically works the same as with The Old Reader.

First, set your urls-source:

urls-source "feedhq"
Then, configure your FeedHQ credentials:

feedhq-login "your-feedhq-account"
feedhq-password "your-password"
Note that double quotes should be escaped, i.e. you should write \" instead of ".

See also feedhq-passwordfile, feedhq-passwordeval and Section 4.25, “Passwords for external APIs”.

if you’re using a standalone instance, you should add one more setting:

feedhq-url "https://the.url.of/your/feedhq/instance"
When you start newsboat, it will download the feeds that you configured in FeedHQ. Please take a closer look at the configuration commands for what you can configure in newsboat regarding FeedHQ.

FeedHQ’s folders are converted into Newsboat tags. You can select and filter feeds by tags; see Section 4.1, “Tagging” and Section 4.5, “Filter Language” for details.

4.11. Tiny Tiny RSS Synchronization
Newsboat can be used to synchronize with Tiny Tiny RSS installations. Tiny Tiny RSS is a web-based and (optionally) multi-user feed reader. By providing the ability to use Tiny Tiny RSS as its backend, it’s possible for users to manage their subscriptions centrally within Tiny Tiny RSS while reading them wherever they are using newsboat.

If you want to use Tiny Tiny RSS support, don’t forget to activate the external API support in your preferences.

To use Tiny Tiny RSS support, you need to configure a few things. First of all, newsboat needs to know that you want to use Tiny Tiny RSS and which installation exactly:

urls-source "ttrss"
ttrss-url "http://example.com/ttrss/"
In addition, it requires username and password for authentication:

ttrss-login "myusername"
ttrss-password "mypassword"
Note that double quotes should be escaped, i.e. you should write \" instead of ".

See also ttrss-passwordfile, ttrss-passwordeval and Section 4.25, “Passwords for external APIs”.

Tiny Tiny RSS provides two modes of usage, single-user mode and multi-user mode. newsboat needs to know about this, too: In single-user mode, authentication is done via Basic HTTP authentication, while in multi-user mode, authentication is done against Tiny Tiny RSS itself.

ttrss-mode "single"             # "multi" is default
If Tiny Tiny RSS is configured in multi-user mode and still deployed behind an additional HTTP-BasicAuth, the required username and password (which may deviate from ttrss-login and ttrss-password) can be specified in the user-part of the url like this:

ttrss-url "http://htuser:htpasswd@example.com/ttrss/"
With these settings, newsboat should be able to connect to Tiny Tiny RSS and download your subscribed feeds. Articles or even complete feeds that you marked as read are synchronized directly to Tiny Tiny RSS.

Tiny Tiny RSS provides the ability to "star" and to "publish" articles. Starred articles are basically bookmarks, while published articles can be retrieved via a public RSS feed. Newsboat allows the use of these features by mapping its flags to the "star" and "publish" operations.

In order to use this mapping, you need to configure the flags that shall be used:

ttrss-flag-star "s"
ttrss-flag-publish "p"
After that, use these flags when you edit flags for an article, and these articles will be starred resp. published.

TT-RSS folders are converted into Newsboat tags. You can select and filter feeds by tags; see Section 4.1, “Tagging” and Section 4.5, “Filter Language” for details.

4.12. ownCloud News Synchronization
To use ownCloud News support you need to configure a few things.

First, set your urls-source to ocnews and tell Newsboat where to find your ownCloud instance:

urls-source "ocnews"
ocnews-url "https://localhost/owncloud"
Username and password are required:

ocnews-login "user"
ocnews-password "password"
See also ocnews-passwordfile, ocnews-passwordeval and Section 4.25, “Passwords for external APIs”.

ownCloud News API uses HTTP basic auth, therefore running ownCloud with SSL is highly recommended.

ownCloud News provides the ability to "star" articles; starred articles are basically bookmarks. Newsboat allows the use of this feature by mapping user-specified flag to the "star" operation.

In order to use this mapping, you need to configure the flag that shall be used:

ocnews-flag-star "s"
If for any reason you don’t want Newsboat to verify the hostname of your instance against the hostname specified in the SSL certificate you’re using, just say so:

ocnews-verifyhost "no"
OwnCloud News' folders are converted into Newsboat tags. You can select and filter feeds by tags; see Section 4.1, “Tagging” and Section 4.5, “Filter Language” for details.

4.13. OPML Online Subscription Mode
The OPML online subscription mode works similar to the Google Reader synchronization mode, except that no information about read articles is synchronized back. When enabled, all feeds that are listed in the feed list will be taken from one or more OPML files that are downloaded from a freely configurable URL.

To enable this mode, the following configuration needs to be done:

urls-source "opml"
opml-url "<opml url>" ["<opml url>" ...]
"opml" must be specified as source for the feed URLs, and the URLs of the OPML file needs to be specified, too.

4.14. Inoreader Support
Inoreader is another successor to Google Reader. Newsboat provides functionality to use Inoreader as its backend: people can use Inoreader to manage their subscriptions, and in addition, use newsboat to download and read articles. Newsboat will keep the information which articles have already been read synchronized with Inoreader, so that users usually won’t see articles more than once. In addition, it will only ever download unread articles from Inoreader.

In order to use Inoreader support, you first need to configure the proper URL source:

urls-source "inoreader"
In addition, newsboat needs to know your Inoreader username and password so that it can authenticate with Inoreader. Note that this is NOT your login with your Google or Facebook account. If you use one of those to login to Inoreader, you have to create a username and password in Inoreader Preferences > Profile

inoreader-login "your-inoreader-account"
inoreader-password "your-password"
(Note that double quotes should be escaped, i.e. you should write \" instead of ".)

See also inoreader-passwordfile and inoreader-passwordeval.

After setting these configuration values, you can start newsboat, it will authenticate with Inoreader and download your subscription list. If you use "folders" in Inoreader to organize your feeds, newsboat will regard them and make them available via its "tags" capability: each feed is tagged with the name of the folder in which it resides. You can select and filter feeds by tags; see Section 4.1, “Tagging” and Section 4.5, “Filter Language” sections for details.

When you mark single items or complete feeds as read, newsboat will synchronize this information directly to Inoreader. This, of course, includes opening articles. Toggling read articles back to "unread" is also communicated to Inoreader.

In addition, Inoreader provides the ability to "star" and to "share" articles. Starred articles are basically bookmarks, while shared articles are shown to people that follow your Inoreader account. Newsboat allows the use of this feature by mapping its powerful "flags" to the "star"/"unstar" resp. "share"/"unshare" operations.

In order to use this mapping, all you need to do is to configure the flags that shall be used:

inoreader-flag-share "a"
inoreader-flag-star "b"
After that, use these flags when you edit flags for an article, and these articles will be starred resp. shared.

By default, newsboat also shows Inoreader "special feeds":

Starred items
Shared items
Liked items
Saved web pages
You can disable these feeds by setting the following configuration variable:

inoreader-show-special-feeds no
4.15. Flagging Articles
To support custom categorization of articles by the user, it is possible to flag an article. A valid flag is any character from A to Z and from a to z. Every article can be flagged with up to 52 different flags, i.e. every letter from the Roman alphabet in upper and lower case. Flagging is easy: just select an article in the article list, or enter the article view, and press "Ctrl-E". This will start the flag editor. By pressing "Enter", the new flags are saved. You can cancel by pressing the "Esc" key.

The flags of an article can be used in every filter expression. The flags of an article are always ordered, and when new flags are added, ordering is immediately restored. This behaviour can also be relied upon when querying articles via the filter language.

If an article contains one or more flags, it is marked with an "!" in the article list. In the article view, all flags (if available) are listed.

4.16. Macro Support
In newsboat, it’s possible to define macros to execute more than one command at once. A macro is configured using the macro configuration command. The first parameter to macro is the key, all parameters afterwards are operations (as listed in the Available Operations table above), optionally with parameters on their own, separated by the ; character. Here’s a simple example:

macro k open ; reload ; quit
macro o open-in-browser ; toggle-article-read "read"
When the user presses the macro prefix ("," by default) and then the "k" key, the three operations open, reload and quit will be executed subsequently.

It is also possible to modify configuration variables within macros, which can e.g. be used to temporarily modify the browser configuration variable to do something else, such as running an image viewer from the URLs view:

macro i set browser "feh %u"; open-in-browser ; set browser "elinks %u"
You can even use this feature to enqueue any of the URLs from the URLs view to podboat’s download queue:

macro E set browser "echo %u >> ~/.newsboat/queue" ; open-in-browser ; set browser "elinks %u"
4.17. Commandline Commands
Newsboat comes with a -x option that indicates that commands added as arguments to the command line shall be executed. Currently, the following commands are available:

reload: this option reloads all feeds, and quits newsboat without printing any output. This is useful if a user wants to periodically reload all feeds without always having a running newsboat instance, e.g. from cron.
print-unread: this option prints the number of unread articles and quits newsboat. This is useful for users who want to integrate this number into some kind of monitoring system.
4.18. Format Strings
Newsboat contains a powerful format string system to make it possible for the user to configure the format of various aspects of the application, such as the format of entries in the feed list or in the article list.

Format strings are similar to those that are found in the printf function in the C programming language. A format sequence begins with the % character, followed by optional alignment indication: positive numbers indicate that the text that is inserted for the sequence shall be padded right to a total width that is specified by the number, while negative number specify left padding. Followed by the padding indication comes the actual sequence identifier, which is usually a single letter.

In addition, newsboat provides other, more powerful sequences, such as %>[char], which indicates that the text right to the sequence will be aligned right on the screen, and characters between the text on the left and the text on the right will be filled by [char]. Another powerful format is the conditional sequence, %?[char]?[format 1]&[format 2]?: if the text of the sequence identifier [char] is non-empty, then [format 1] will be evaluated and inserted, otherwise [format 2] will be evaluated and inserted. The & and [format 2] are optional, i.e. if the identifier’s text is empty, then an empty string will be inserted.

The following tables show what sequence identifiers are available for which format:

4.19. Highlighting Text
Newsboat supports the highlighting of text in the feed list, the article list and the article view, using regular expressions to describe patterns to be highlighted. The command syntax goes like this:

highlight <target> <regex> <fgcolor> [<bgcolor> [<attribute> ...]]
Valid values for <target> are feedlist, articlelist, article and all. When specifying all, the matching will be done in all three views. The <regex> must be regular expression, which will be matched case-insensitive against the text. <fgcolor> and <bgcolor> specify the foreground color resp. the background color of the matches. You can also specify 0 or more attributes. You can find a list of valid colors and attributes in the Section 3.2, “Configuring Colors”.

Examples for possible highlighting configurations are:

highlight all "newsboat" red
highlight article "^(Feed|Title|Author|Link|Date):" default default underline
highlight feedlist "https?://[^ ]+" yellow red bold
Highlighting Articles in the Article List
In addition to generally highlighting text, there is also a specific way to highlight articles in the article list based on whether they match a certain filter expression. This means that you can highlight items in the article list based on their content. This is done using the highlight-article configuration command.

The syntax is similar to the highlight configuration command, with the difference that there’s no need to specify a target (since it only applies in the article list), and instead of a regular expression, a filter expression is used. After the filter expression, the colors and attributes are specified in the same way.

Example:

highlight-article "author =~ \"Andreas Krennmair\"" white red bold
4.20. Advanced Dialog Management
Newsboat supports an advanced concept of dialogs. Previously, all dialogs (feed list, article list, article view) were internally laid out as a pure stack. In 2.0, this changed: all dialogs are managed in a list, and the user can jump to another, previously opened dialog from everywhere. This allows a user to open more than one article list, more than one article view, etc., and switch between them without closing them.

The main dialog for this feature can be reached by pressing the "v" key. This opens the list of open dialogs. From there, the user can switch to another dialog by selecting the appropriate entry and pressing "Enter", or can close open dialogs by selecting them and pressing "Ctrl-X".

4.21. XDG Base Directory Support
Newsboat implements limited support for the XDG Base Directory Specification. It needs to be set up manually by creating the following directories:

~/.local/share/newsboat/
~/.config/newsboat/
If these directories exist or the environment variables $XDG_CONFIG_HOME and $XDG_DATA_HOME are set, newsboat will use these directories, otherwise it will default to ~/.newsboat as its configuration directory.

If you’re currently using ~/.newsboat/ but wish to migrate to XDG directories, you should move the files as follows:

config, urls
to $HOME/.config/newsboat/
cache.db, history.search, history.cmdline, queue
to $HOME/.local/share/newsboat/
4.22. Podcast Support
A podcast is a media file distributed over the internet using syndication feeds such as RSS, for later playback on portable players or computers. Newsboat contains support for downloading and saving podcasts. This support differs a bit from other podcast aggregators or "podcatchers" in how it is done.

Podcast content is transported in RSS feeds via special tags called "enclosures". Newsboat recognizes these enclosures and stores the relevant information for every podcast item it finds in an RSS feed. Since version 2.0, it also recognizes and handles the Yahoo Media RSS extensions. What the user then can do is to add the podcast download URL to a download queue. Alternatively, newsboat can be configured to automatically do that. This queue is stored in the file $HOME/.newsboat/queue.

The user can then use the download manager podboat to download these files to a directory on the local filesystem. Podboat comes with the newsboat package, and features a look and feel very close to the one of newsboat. It also shares the same configuration file.

Podcasts that have been downloaded but haven’t been played yet remain in the queue but are marked as downloaded. You can remove them by purging them from the queue with the "P" key. After you’ve played a file and close podboat, it will be removed from the queue. The downloaded file remains on the filesystem.

Table 15. Podboat Configuration Commands

Configuration Command	Argument(s)	Default	Description	Example
download-path

<path>

~/
Specifies the directory where podboat shall download the files to. Optionally, the placeholders "%n" (for the podcast feed’s name) and "%h" (for the podcast feed’s hostname) can be used to place downloads in a directory structure.

download-path "~/Downloads/%h/%n"
max-downloads

<number>

1
Specifies the maximum number of parallel downloads when automatic download is enabled.

max-downloads 3
player

<player command>

""
Specifies the player that shall be used for playback of downloaded files.

player "mp3blaster"

Table 16. Available Operations in Podboat

Operation	Default key	Description
quit

q

Quit the program.

pb-download

d

Download the currently selected URL.

pb-cancel

c

Cancel the currently selected download.

pb-play

p

Start player with currently selected download.

pb-delete

D

Delete the currently selected URL from the queue.

pb-purge

P

Remove all finished and deleted downloads from the queue and load URLs that were newly added to the queue.

pb-toggle-download-all

a

Toggle the "automatic download" feature where all queued URLs are downloaded one after the other. The "max-downloads" configuration option controls how many downloads are done in parallel.

pb-increase-max-dls

+

Increase the "max-downloads" option by 1.

pb-decrease-max-dls

-

Decrease the "max-downloads" option by 1. If the option is already 1, no further decrease is possible.


A usual "use case" is to configure newsboat to automatically enqueue newly found podcast download URLs. Then, the user reloads the podcast RSS feeds in newsboat, and after that, uses podboat to view the current queue, and either selectively download certain files or automatically download them all together by pressing "a" within podboat.

4.23. Running multiple copies of Newsboat simultaneously
During development and testing, you might want to run a second copy of Newsboat, operating with different config, URLs list or cache file. This can be achieved by creative use of XDG environment variables. This approach is not beautiful, but it works.

First of all, you will need to create a directory to store the data. Let’s call it test:

$ mkdir -p test/newsboat
Note that we also create a subdirectory called newsboat; this is required to satisfy XDG specification. ATTENTION: if this subdirectory is absent, Newsboat will attempt to run on your live data!

You can now create config and urls files inside test/newsboat; you can also copy cache.db if you don’t want to start with a fresh one.

When the files are ready, you can invoke Newsboat as follows:

$ XDG_CONFIG_HOME=test XDG_DATA_HOME=test newsboat
(This will look newsboat binary up in your PATH; if you’ve just built your own, use ./newsboat instead, or provide a full path.)

By modifying the environment in which Newsboat runs you also modify environments of all the programs that Newsboat starts; that includes filters and external HTML renderers. If they rely on XDG_* variables, they will look for things in test directory and might fail.

For filters, you should either copy the files they need to test, or invoke them in such a way that they don’t look in XDG directories at all.

For renderers, you can work around the issue by undoing the modifications to environment, e.g.:

html-renderer "XDG_CONFIG_HOME=$HOME/.config XDG_DATA_HOME=$HOME/.data w3c"
As already said: not beautiful, but gets the job done.

4.24. Using SQLite Triggers with newsboat
This section was written by Elrond, originally for Newsbeuter.

SQLite, the db used by newsboat, supports triggers. These are small snippets of SQL that get executed inside the database by the database engine. They’re stored inside the db and the normal user (including newsboat itself) doesn’t see them. Just the db seems to do some magic: Like changing some values when you change another value.

So what is this good for when looking at newsboat? Well, first off, it’s a hack. The real answer should be to use application logic (do it inside newsboat, not in the db). So: Don’t use this, unless you know, what you’re doing, and unless you have some sort of backup.

Example
So after the "don’t use it" you still want to know, what one can do? So here’s an example.

Suppose you have a strange feed where the articles become "new" by just changing their subject, and nothing else changes. The body is just empty, and the URL keeps the same. This feed really exists. It’s the "updated software rss feed" of some major company and the title just contains the name of the driver and version number. And the URL points to the download page. newsboat considers articles only as new, when they have a new UniqueID (this is good). So those articles are never marked as new (unread) ever again.

So what can we do? We do some magic: We let the db test if newsboat changes the subject and then let itself mark the article again as unread.

You need the sqlite3 command line tool (available via apt-get install sqlite3 on Debian) or some other tool to do direct sql on the sqlite database.
Start sqlite3 with the newsboat db:

Rivendell:~/.newsboat% sqlite3 cache.db
SQLite version 3.4.2
Enter ".help" for instructions
sqlite>
Create the trigger:

sqlite> create trigger update_item_title update of title on rss_item
          > for each row when old.title != new.title
          > begin
          >   update rss_item set unread = 1 where rowid == new.rowid;
          > end;
Leave sqlite3 with "Ctrl-D" or .quit.
That’s it. newsboat (well, its db) now marks articles as unread when their title changes. And nicely enough this works all inside newsboat, no need to restart it so that it rereads the cache, that magically modifies itself. It just works.

4.25. Passwords for external APIs
When using external APIs for newsfeeds, the user has different options for how to provide the password to authenticate against the API. Instead of directly writing the password into the configuration file, the user can choose to provide a file containing the password or an external command that evaluates to the user’s password. This is useful if the user wants to share the configuration file online or store the password in a password manager or the systems keyring.

For example when using the API for "The Old Reader", newsboat will first check the oldreader-password configuration variable, if this variable is set (meaning it’s present and not empty), then its value will be used for authentication. If oldreader-password is not set (meaning it’s not present or it’s empty) but the oldreader-passwordfile configuration variable is set, then the first line of this file will be used as the password. This is, unless the file doesn’t exist, is unreadable or its first line is empty, in those cases Newsboat will exit with an error. If oldreader-passwordfile is not set but oldreader-passwordeval is set, then the command will be evaluated and the first line of the result will be used as the password. This is, unless the first line of the result’s string is empty, in those cases Newsboat will exit with an error. Newsboat will ignore the exit status of the command, however it will wait for the command to exit. The command’s output to stderr will be ignored by Newsboat and forwarded to the user, the output to stdout on the other hand will never be printed. If neither oldreader-password, oldreader-passwordfile nor oldreader-passwordeval are set, then Newsboat will ask for the user’s password with an interactive prompt. The entered password will be used unless it is empty, in which case Newsboat will exit with an error.
