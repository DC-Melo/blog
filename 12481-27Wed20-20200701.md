# ▽  about RET key 
First, RET is not a physical (keyboard) key. It is a logical key -- the Emacs way of writing what your physical Return or Enter key
typically sends to Emacs: a Control-M character (which Emacs also writes as C-m, when describing the Ctrl + m key sequence). And if your
physical Return or Enter key sends something else, then Emacs writes that as the pseudo-function key <return>. And Emacs automatically maps
<return> to RET, unless <return> is itself bound to a different command than RET. (Note that the ASCII control character Control-M is also
called a carriage return character, and C-m is essentially another way of writing RET.)

Second, the minibuffer uses its own keymaps. And in those RET is generally bound to a different command than it is outside the minibuffer.
Similarly, C-j is bound to a different command that it is outside the minibuffer.

Control J is the ASCII control character for a newline -- the newline character. So in some Emacs modes C-j inserts a newline character
(sometimes written \n). This is a convention -- nothing forces a correspondence between the key sequence C-j and insertion of a newline
(i.e., Control J) character.

But C-j does not do this in the minibuffer, not by default anyway. In the minibuffer, both RET and C-j terminate your minibuffer input and
accept (read) it.

Third, your question is presumably what command RET is bound to in the minibuffer (by default). It can depend on which minibuffer keymap is
currently active. But you can find out what it is bound to by examining the minibuffer keymaps.

To see the keys bound in a given minibuffer keymap, load library help-fns+.el and use M-k. When it asks you for a keymap variable, type one
of the minibuffer keymap variable names. The names all start with minibuffer-local-, so you can type that and hit TAB for completion.

The main (base) keymap is minibuffer-local-map. The other maps generally inherit its key bindings and supplement them with other bindings.
In minibuffer-local-map, RET is bound by default to exit-minibuffer. But in minibuffer-local-must-match-map, RET is bound by default to
minibuffer-complete-and-exit. You get the idea.
