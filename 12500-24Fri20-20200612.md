SUNRISE:
    tdd:测试驱动开发
        包括：实现测试，验证新写的测试会失败，编写实现测试的功能，验证心得测试和旧的测试会一起通过，重构代码。


MORNING:
▣ emmage:只能测试user自己按转的apk，无法测试系统应用。
JavaScript是工作在浏览器端的脚本语言，提交的数据是交给浏览器处理的。
PHP是工作在服务器端的，提交的数据交给服务器处理，服务器再响应到浏览器。

NOON:
Checking for X11-clipboard support in terminalEdit
Getting Vim to work with the X11 clipboard can be a struggle if you want to run Vim in a terminal. In this case, you will have to check for X11 clipboard support. The GUI version of Vim always has clipboard support.
From the console, type:
vim --version | grep clipboard
If you see +clipboard or +xterm_clipboard, you are good to go. If it's -clipboard and -xterm_clipboard, you will need to look for a version of Vim that was compiled with clipboard support. On Debian and Ubuntu, to obtain clipboard support install the packages vim-gtk or vim-gnome (not vim-tiny).

AFTERNOON:
▣ git clone only one folder 
git init test && cd test     //新建仓库并进入文件夹
git config core.sparsecheckout true //设置允许克隆子目录
echo 'tt*' >> .git/info/sparse-checkout //设置要克隆的仓库的子目录路径   //空格别漏
git remote add origin git@github.com:mygithub/test.git  //这里换成你要克隆的项目和库
git pull origin master    //下载
▣ error: stray '\302' in program
sed -i 's/\o32//g' file.1
